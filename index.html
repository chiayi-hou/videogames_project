        <h2>Overall Introduction</h2>
        <p>Video games have long been a popular form of entertainment, and with the advent of game streaming, their sales are now influenced not only by their quality but also by their popularity in various regions. Understanding how video game sales vary across different regions is crucial in today's global gaming landscape, as it could help publishers develop games that are best suited to market preferences, targeting their customers more effectively. The main goal of our project is to explore this phenomenon to uncover the underlying factors shaping consumer preferences and purchasing behaviors.
            To inform our research, we will draw upon insights from two reference papers:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8858995/"> overview of the gaming industry across nations: using analytics with power BI to forecast and identify key influencers</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/sites/default/files/usclap/2017-2/Factors_that_Impact_Video_Game_Sales.pdf"> Factors that Impact Video Game Sales</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>    Additionally, static images from Statista will be utilized to provide visual context to our findings, respectively. Through a careful examination of these resources,
            our project aims to contribute valuable insights into the complex dynamics of video game sales.

    <h2>Introduction to the Data</h2>
    <p>We collected our data from Kaggle's website. The data contains 11 fields, 5 categorical and 6 continuous,
        and has a data size of 16,598. The detail information about the features are listed in the following table:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Variable Name</th>
                <th>Details</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>Name</td><td>the name of video games</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Platform</td><td>the platform of the game's release</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Year</td><td>Year of the game’s release</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Genre</td><td>Genre of the game</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Publisher</td><td>Publisher of the game</td></tr>
            <tr><td>NA_sales</td><td>Sales in North America (millions)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>EU_sales</td><td>Sales in Europe (millions)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>JP_sales</td><td>Sales in Japan(millions)</td></tr>

            <img src="plots/histogram_game_count_by_year.png" alt="Histogram of Games by Year" >
            <p id="histogram_explaination">
                This is a histogram for the video game count for each year. From the visualization, you can notice that the data collection for video
                games started decreasing since 2011 and the count came to 0 at around 2016, which shows this dataset is less precise for the recent years.
                Therefore, it is important for us to pay attention on the change on total sales for recent years. Still, since we are focusing our research 
                on "how sales differ by region," this dataset could still be helpful for us to understnad each region's preferences on video games.
            </p>

        </div>

        <p> With this information about each video game, we will be able to answer our question, “How do regions affect the sales of video games,”
            by looking at the change in sales for factors such as publisher or platform, we might
            be able to figure out each region’s preference of video games.

        <h2>Total Video Game Sales by Region in Each Year</h2>

        <iframe id="stacked_bar" src="plots/combined_chart.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <p id="stacked_bar_analysis" class="fullpage_text">
            The visualization is an interactive stacked bar chart that is colored the bars by the video game sales in each 
            region, where blue represents Europe, red represents Japan, green represents North America, and gray represents 
            sales from other regions. By choosing the year by the slider below, the bar chart by the side will show the bar chart 
            of video game sales by region for the selected year.
        </p>
        <p class="fullpage_text">
            First, the bar chart shows that video game sales started to grow substantially in 1996, and were the highest in 2008; 
            after then, they continued to decrease since then. We can also notice that sales in North America mostly accounted for the 
            largest portion of total sales, except for 1993 to 1995. Secondly, by changing the year for the pie chart, we can notice that 
            sales in Japan started to grow and take an important place in video game sales since 1983, where JP_Sales grew from zero 
            (too low to be included separately; might be included in Other_Sales) to about the half of the total sale. 
            Also, we can notice that video game sales in Japan were always higher than the ones in Europe before 1995, 
            while the sales in Europe started to grow and become the second largest market since 2001.

                <p> This chart shows the top10 publishers by global sales. Nintendo's sales after 2000 are far more than all other publishers,
                showing its market leadership. Electronic Art and Activision surpassed Sony Computer Entertainment after 2000. In general,
                the game market is expanding after 2000, all of them have noticeable progress changes.

            <img src="plots/sankey.png" alt="Top 50 Publishers to Region">
            <p class="text" id="sankey_analysis">
                The figure at the side is a Sankey diagram for the top 50 publishers vs. the three regions. With this visualization, we can 
                take a look at whether each region has its preference for the video game publisher. First, you can notice that the visualization 
                is arranged so that the publishers at the upper are more preferred by North America and less preferred by Japan while the ones 
                at the lower position are more preferred by Japan. The plot also shows the top 5 publishers during the period were Nintendo,
                 Electronic Arts, Activision, Sony Computer Entertainment, and Ubisoft. Among these 5 publishers, you can notice that publishers
                  from Western countries like Activision (California), Electronic Arts (California), and Ubisoft (France) are only preferred by 
                  North America and Europe, whereas publishers from Japan like Nintendo and Sony Computer Entertainment are preferred by all three 
                  of them. From this, we might be able to speculate that Japan has a preference for its domestic games, while North America and 
                  Europe have less preference for the region of the publisher.

            <div class="text">
                <p> This set of charts shows video game sales data for different regions (North America, Europe, Japan, and Other), sorted by game genre.
                    Each chart uses a different color for each region.
                    The x-axis of the bars represents sales (in millions of dollars) and the vertical axis represents the different game
                    genres. In North America, ACTION games have the highest sales and STRATEGY games have the lowest sales. The European market is closer to the
                    North American market in terms of game genre preference. In Japan, Role-Playing (RPG) games dominate the Japanese market, with a significant
                    difference in preference from other regions. Among the other regions, strategy sales are the lowest, following the same trend as the other
                    regions. Overall, in the global market, ACTION and SPORT sell well, and STRATEGY, PUZZLE, and ADVENTURE sell less well.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="fullpage_text">
            From the six visualizations, we learned that first, North America has been the biggest market for almost all kinds of games over time. 
            Also, we noticed that North America and Europe almost have the same preference for games. For example, the ranking for each genre for North America and 
            Europe are exactly the same and they both similar preference of the video game publishers. On the other hand, Japan's preference is way more different 
            where they are passionate about Role-Playing games and preferred their own video game publishers more. With this information, we can answer our research 
            question that region does affect a lot on the video games sales because of the preferences of game genres and publishers; still, the difference is not
            significant for neighboring regions (like North America and Europe) possibly because of the similar culture background.
